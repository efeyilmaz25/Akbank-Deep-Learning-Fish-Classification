# Fish-Classification-Akbank-Deep-Learning

**Fish Species Classification Project**

This project aims to create an artificial neural network (ANN) model using deep learning techniques for the classification of various fish species. Within the scope of the project, classification of certain species was carried out by using the physical characteristics of fish. The dataset used in the training and testing processes of the model contains an equal number of data for each fish species. After training, the model performance was evaluated with metrics such as accuracy, loss, precision and recall.

**About the Project**

The fish species classification problem is solved with a dataset consisting of 9 different classes, each containing 200 data points. These classes include various fish species such as Black Sea Sprat, Gilt-Head Bream, Hourse Mackerel, Red Mullet, Sea Bass, Shrimp and Trout. The artificial neural network model used in the project processes the data and performs the learning process to correctly classify fish species. During the training process, the weights of the model were optimized, and during the testing process, the results were observed with the complexity matrix and various performance metrics.

**Technologies Used**

This project was developed using the Python programming language and various machine learning libraries. TensorFlow and Keras libraries were used to create and train the model. Additionally, Numpy and Pandas were used for data manipulation, while Matplotlib was used to visualize the results. Scikit-learn library was used to evaluate the performance of the model.
